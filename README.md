# PlatformIO_gTestgMock
How to set up your PlatformIO project with Google's C++ test framework gTest/gMock to work seamlessly together

## About this repository
This repository contains the basic setup for a Hardware Abstraction Layer, enabling Mock classes that can fake a behavior for the unit under test to work on. It also features initial unit tests that both outline how to work with gTest and gMock to check inputs (Matchers) and outputs (behavior) of software units under test.
